### Additional Class Thoughts

#### Mikes:

Dena asked a really great question somewhere in the [middle of class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzPLPns5UbM&t=1803s), "What are people's opinions on why he says 'behold the wrath of God is upon the seed of thy brethren'. I feel like we talk about the wrath of God being on people a lot, but I also feel like that's not really the Heavenly Father that I know. What was the prophets' purpose in saying 'the Wrath of God'? Does 'wrath' mean something different?"

I've been studying the Old Testament this past year and a half and I have actually had this question on my mind a LOT. I have a lot of thoughts on this that I didn't express to the group because they were too lengthy. So if you're reading thisâ€¦ sorry it's so long and good luck :-) send me your responses and I'll post them here as well.

##### Whole Cities Swallowed

Firstly, whole cities are swallowed up in the Book of Mormon, and the Lord sites a very interesting reason - they slew the prophets, and the blood of the prophets and the saints cried up to Him from the ground (3 Nephi 9:5 and the whole chapter, really). It's possible this kindled the "wrath of the Lord" toward those wicked people in those cities. Like, "you're doing bad things, and I'm going to remove you from the Earth, you're done."

##### Printing Press

Second thought is the [printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press). The invention of the gutenberg printing press ~ 1455 - 1500 A.D. brought into circulation so many bibles. This was inspired. Previous to that time so many people didn't have access to the written word of God that they could hold in their own hands and ponder the words at their own pace and in their own time. I think it makes for a more righteous people, on average, when people can individually review God's word like how you can when you hold scriptures in your own hands. Before that you had to hear the word from a teacher at a once a week meeting or something, right? And that's really not enough.

I know in the old times written word was still distributed on parchment or bark. But still, that is not as ubiquitous as a printed bible. And I can't help but think that that lack of access had an affect on the minds and hearts of the people.

The Jews wore [phylacteries](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/phylactery) to remember the things of God. If you consider the lack of access to the written word of God, doing something like phylacteries begins to make sense. You want to remember what you've learned. If they had a handheld bible they could have referenced more easily the words of eternal life. And maybe greater righteousness could have been there on a bigger scale.

Because of the people's lack of ready-access to the written word of God, I think it contributed to greater wickedness and barbarism, thus invoking the "wrath of the Lord" more often.

##### Barbarism

The people in the old testament times were just more barbaric. It was a barbaric age of the world. Violence was so prevalent, I think it was a form of communication. People were tribal. He who carried the biggest stick enjoyed power, control, and peace. Here's some examples.

- The Israelites were instructed by the Lord to intimidate their enemies in order to enjoy peace as they pushed people out of the land that is now Israel.
- Joshua 10:25-27 Joshua skewers kings on a pole to send a message.
- In 1 Samuel 15:3 Samuel the prophet commands Saul the king of Israel to utterly destroy every living thing of the Amalekites including women, children, and infants.
- And in 1 Kings 2:5,9 Solomon receives David's deathbed instructions to kill several people, loose ends David wanted tied up, which Solomon later did.
- The evil queen Jezebel (wife of King of Israel, Ahab) ordered the death of hundreds of the Lord's prophets (1 Kings 18:4.) This is why Elijah was constantly on the lam, and one of the many reasons the Lord's anger was kindled against the then current king of Israel.
- Elijah later retaliates by executing all the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18:40). There are many more examples of barbarism in the old testament.

I think there's a correlation between when death and murder are prevalent in society, and the Lord's wrath coming to bear. It seems the Lord's anger is kindled against the perpetrators. During our day, we have enjoyed so much peace, on average, we may not be hearing about this side of the Lord as much.

##### The Lord Can Feel Emotion

Thirdly, the Lord is capable of feeling emotion. Anger is an emotion. He is perfect, but since when does perfection mean you can't feel anger? In this set of verses, Moses 7:28-40 Enoch sees the Lord weep, and is curious because (it seems) he didn't think the Lord felt sadness like that. But the people were very wicked just before the flood in Noah's day. "And the afire of mine bindignation is kindled against them; and in my hot displeasure will I send in the cfloods upon them, for my fierce anger is kindled against them." The Lord feels sad, and the heavens weep. The Lord talks of his fierce anger all the time, even in the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants. He is capable of feeling great anger, and He seems to act in response to the heinous action of His children.

The Lord of the vineyard is troubled (Jacob 5) because of the wickedness of the vineyard. And He's always grafting branches around the vineyard trying to raise up and preserve good fruit. My opinion is this implies that the default in the Vineyard is bad fruit. And it kindles the wrath of the Lord.

##### Evil Lamanites and Nephites

Another example is the Nephites near the end of their civilization. Though they were warring with the Lamanites, we learn there really wasn't much difference between their wickedness and the wickedness of the Lamanites. Mormon 4. In this time period of the book of Mormon the Lord has a different way of speaking than in the relative peace times we read about in Mosiah, Alma, and 3 Nephi. Mormon was a prophet seeing it happen a lot and he says "For I know that such will sorrow for the calamity of the house of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for the destruction of this people; they will sorrow that this people had not repented that they might have been clasped in the arms of Jesus." There is the love that seems to be missing in a lot of old testament scripture.

The Wrath of the Lord and the Love of the Lord is not inconsistent, in my opinion. It's just good parenting.

##### The Lord is a Perfect Parent

I'm not a full grown parent, so take this with the obvious grain of salt.

The Lord is a perfect parent. He's a perfect Father (and he has a perfect [Mother](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/mother-in-heaven?lang=eng) by his side). And I ponder at times at how much better His parenting style is over mine. The gap is gnarly-wide.

But, indulge me for a second, what if His parenting style involves treating and dealing with each child in the exact best way that child needs in order to rise to their perfect potential. Several stories contribute to this idea, like the analogy of the [currant bush](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/04/as-many-as-i-love-i-rebuke-and-chasten?lang=eng) and the Lord as the gardener cutting down some while others grow tall, and how hard the Savior was on Peter in particular while other apostles he seemed to not put as much pressure on. How he judged the Lamanites differently than the Nephites because of their upbringing (Alma 9:15-16).

I'm not saying the Lord loves certain individuals more than others, no. I'm just saying he parents them differently than others. He parents perfectly because he knows His children perfectly, and He perfectly knows their potential, their gifts, and their life experiences.

This idea of parenting His children differently and perfectly I think can shed light on why we see an inconsistency in how He speaks (through his prophets) to different generations in scripture differently. To one generation he tells them His wrath is kindled against them, to another generation he says his arm is stretched out still with an open invitation to repent and come unto him because he loves them. Often we hear prophets and general authorities proclaiming from the pulpit how deep the Lord's love is for us and how much he truly is begging people to repent and come unto him.

I don't see these two messages as inconsistent, but more a reflection of the people the Lord is talking to at the time. How far down the scale has your evil gotten? The heart of the child merits a different message.
