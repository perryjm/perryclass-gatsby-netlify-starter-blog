## Class Notes

Mike read the following quote and some asked for it to be posted

Elder Eyring, 2005, "Spiritual Preparedness: Start Early and Be Steady"

> So, the great test of life is to see whether we will hearken to and obey Godâ€™s commands in the midst of the storms of life. It is not to endure storms, but to choose the right while they rage. And the tragedy of life is to fail in that test and so fail to qualify to return in glory to our heavenly home.
